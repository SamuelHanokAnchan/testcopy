# image-resource-planner

A proof-of-concept platform for planning and estimating resources for construction projects using drone imagery. Developed in collaboration with students supporting AD-Evolution, a startup focused on digital innovation. The project is part of a research initiative and may serve as the basis for academic publications.

## Purpose

This project aims to enable manual and automated selection of areas from aerial pictures (e.g., taken by drones) to:
- Select regions of interest (e.g., using SAM)
- Automatically calculate surface area
- Estimate the required amount of materials based on preconfigured material profiles

### Proof of Concept
- **First step:** Plan driveways and sidewalks (structures without angles)
- **Next step:** Support angled structures (e.g., rooftops)

## What We Provide
- Example pictures
- GitHub repository access
